# Introduction

Teacher said that hooks were introduced in React on React 16.8 and are linked to **useState**, normally imported in the following format:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

Teacher said that we have to remember to import from React and not from React Native.

Teacher said that we also have the hook Use Effect.

Teacher also said that the code in React Native and in the React web is the same when we are talking about hooks.

Teacher said that the hook always return to us a function and a variable.
