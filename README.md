# Introduction

Teacher said that hooks were introduced in React on React 16.8 and are linked to **useState**, normally imported in the following format:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

Teacher said that we also have the hook Use Effect.

Teacher also said that the code in React Native and in the React web is the same when we are talking about hooks.
